A day's work

My father is always very busy. In the morning, he cooks breakfast and washes the dishes. Then he dresses my baby sister, and sometimes goes to the grocery store or the doctor's office. He does all the shopping for our family! In the afternoon he cleans our house. After he finishes his work, he often watches paints or reads a book. In the evening he makes a delicious dinner for us, he is an excellent chef. We always clean the table after we eat so he can watch television.
