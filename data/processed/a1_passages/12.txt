A Long Day
Ann walked into the bedroom. She woke up the baby, and saw she needed a bottle of milk. After she gave her a bottle, she went to the bathroom and took a shower. She put on some warm clothes because it was cold and rainy outside. Then she started her car, and drove to her job at the library. She stopped her work at 5 o'clock, and said goodbye to everybody. She drove to the bookstore, and then went home.  Ann's husband said the baby was sick, so she gave her some medicine. Then she cooked dinner for everybody, and went to bed very early at 9 o'clock. It was a long day! She was glad tomorrow was a holiday.
