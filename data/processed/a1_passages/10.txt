Restaurants in Town

Bite Size
The new cafe on 4th Street next to the theatre is terrible! I went on Saturday, and there were too many people. I couldn't sit at a table! Also, the waiter was very rude and the sandwich was too dry. You should save you money and eat at home.

Big Burger
Do you want to eat the best burger of your life? Then you should go to Big Burger! The food is not very healthy, but it is delicious. You could also have some chocolate and banana cake after your meal, the cake is great!
