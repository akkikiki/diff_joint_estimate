Farm Animals
We don't think about cows very much, but they are actually very interesting! Cows are very large animals, but you shouldn't be afraid of them. They are nice animals! Baby cows can be really cute, and they are friendly and like to play a lot. Cows eat a lot of grass, but they eat some other plants too. They are an important part of what people eat too. Cows give us milk, and without milk you could not eat cheese, yogurt, or ice cream! Cows also like to be around other cows, they do not like to be alone. They are just like us!

Another interesting farm animal is the pig. Everyone thinks that pigs are dirty, but that isn't true. Pigs like to be clean, but they also like to put wet dirt on their bodies when they feel hot. Pigs are really clever, too. Some people think they are the smartest farm animal.
