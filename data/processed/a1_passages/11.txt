My Family
I have a big family! I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers. I am the third child, so some of them are younger, and some are older. My mom is a nurse, and she works in a big hospital. My dad is a teacher, he teaches math and science at an elementary school. He also is the coach for the football team. My oldest brother plays on the team. My sisters are boring, they do not play any sports. They only like to watch tv and talk on the phone, but they can be funny! My interest is art - I love painting, acting, and playing music.
