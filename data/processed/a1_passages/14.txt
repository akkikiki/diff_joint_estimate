LOST DOG
Please help me find my dog! Her name is Abbie, and she is very friendly. I cam home from work on Tuesday, March 14th, and she was gone! I live next to a big field, so maybe she went to run around. She is black with white feet, and has big, soft ears. She also has a purple ribbon around her neck. She really likes cheese, so put some pieces of cheese in your pocket so that she will like you. If you find her, please bring her to the building on the corner of 2nd Avenue and Oak Street.
