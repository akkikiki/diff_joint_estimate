The travels of an actor

Eric is an actor, and he travels often. Every month he goes to the airport, and takes an airplane to a new place. Sometimes he goes to a foreign country, but sometimes he just travels to a new city. He loves to learn new languages, and last month he practiced some lessons in Spanish. He thinks it is wonderful to speak new languages with the people he meets. This weekend he wants to drive to Mexico, and he is excited to talk with the people there.
