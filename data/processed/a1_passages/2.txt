Hello Tom,
Thank you so much for the nice gift! I am very excited to play the game with my brother and sister. I am fifteen years old now, but games are still fun to play with my family. How are you? My family is well, but my grandmother is sick, which is very sad. I think she is lonely. Maybe we can talk on the phone soon, I miss you a lot!
Talk to you soon,
Sarah
