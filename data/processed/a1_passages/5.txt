A cold day and a hot coffee

The old man wore brown pants and a red hat. It was very cloudy and windy outside, so he also wore a warm, blue coat. He walked quickly to the park, where he stopped and read the newspaper. It was only autumn, but it was very cold! The man stopped reading and started to walk back to the town. It was still early, so he went to the cafe for a nice cup of hot coffee. The waitress brought him his drink and a sandwich, and he thanked her. The coffee was wonderful after his walk in the cold weather!
