Good Morning Mr. Smith,
Thank you for telling me about the book "The Other Side of the Mountain", it was very good. I read it in only 3 days! I wrote some notes in my notebook like you said, so I can use them for my homework. What other books do you think I should read?
Best,
Johnny

Hello Johnny,
I'm so happy you liked the book! It was my favorite when I was younger. All the books by the writer John Steinbeck are very interesting. Try "Of Mice and Men", it is wonderful. Underline any words you do not know, and we can talk about the words in class.
Best,
Mr. Smith
