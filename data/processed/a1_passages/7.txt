The Farm

The farm is a great place to visit in the summer. You can see many animals, like cows and chickens. There are horses too, and you could maybe see some baby animals as well! It is really fun to bring the family to walk around and see everything, you can sometimes give the animals food, too.

Farms usually also grow food, and in the summer you can buy vegetables and fruit to take home. The food you can buy from a farm often tastes much better than the vegetables you can buy in a grocery store. Last week I bought corn, apples, and tomatoes from a farm near my home. I made a lovely salad, it was delicious!
