Dear Grandma,
Thank you so much for the plants you gave me! My garden is beautiful this year. I have a little seat near the door, and I love to sit there and enjoy all the lovely plants. I tried to grow some vegetables too, but they are not really happy. Maybe there is too much sun? The leaves are brown, and they look dry.
Love,
Sam

Dear Sam,
I'm so happy you enjoyed the gift. I thought the pink flowers looked like little hearts! You could look for a book in the library about vegetables, maybe they need more water. Or maybe you are just not lucky! In the future you could plant them where there is not so much sun. But I am glad that the flowers are healthy! Are you going to come to Grandpa's birthday celebration? Call me and tell me if you are, we miss you!
Much love,
Grandma
